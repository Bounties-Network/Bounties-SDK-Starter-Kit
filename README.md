# Bounties Starterkit
*The Bounties SDK is in alpha release*

This builds an example of how to plug in our components library, [authentication starter kit](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/Auth-Tx-Starter-Kit), and contract SDK in order to build UX around transactions and write directly to the [standard bounties contract](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/StandardBounties) via a redux/react SDK.
